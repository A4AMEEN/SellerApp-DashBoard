**Machine Task Setup Instructions**  

Follow the steps below to set up and launch the application:  

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:  
   `cd <project-folder>`  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install all required dependencies:  
   `npm install`  

3. **Start the JSON Server**  
   In a new terminal, navigate to the same project folder and start the JSON server:  
   `json-server --watch db.json`  

4. **Launch the Application**  
   Go back to the first terminal and run the following command to start the Angular application:  
   `ng serve`  
   Alternatively, you can use the shorthand:  
   `ng s`  

**Notes**  
- Ensure that Node.js and Angular CLI are installed on your system.  
- The JSON server should remain running in its terminal while the application is in use.  
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the application.
